            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This website is made for my summer project. It is meant to 
                showcase my frontend skills as well as my understanding of the framework Django. 
                I've done a lot of research in how to layout a webpage and make it responsive which should be shown by this website. 
                I go into more detail on how I've made this website and 
                skills I've developed in the process in the Blog section</p>
